# synopticnew

This is a new repo to practice and test code for the synoptic project. 

All you need to do in order to get the application to run is:

- upzip the files from this repo and download them into an accessible and suitable place on your PC. 
- You must ensure that within the files, there is the PouchDB package as this will allow for Users and Quizzes to be saved to the ClientSide Database that will be used for this application.
